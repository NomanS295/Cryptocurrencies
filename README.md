# Cryptocurrencies
I did use Unsupervised learning, processed data, data clustering, I did reduce dimensions & reduce the principal components using PCA






# The purpose of this Anaylsis
The purpose of this analysis is to use unsupervised machine learning to create a report that includes the types of cryptocurrencies on the trading market and a classification system to group the currencies for clients investment portfolios, The output is unknown, the best method would be unsupervised learning and clustering algorithms to group the currencies. What I have done here is processed the database, I did use PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce data dimension, I did cluster cryptocurrencies using K-Means and visualizing classification results with 2D and 3D scatter plots.




# Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results

The PCA algorithm is used to reduce the cryptocurrencies dimensions to three principal components. in this 3-D scatter plot

Plotting the scatter plot from two cryptocurrency features Using the PCA algorithm is the best method for better visualizations

Most of the cryptocurrencies are part of classes #0 and #3

The Unsupervised machine learning was used to identify clusters of the cryptocurrencies the K-Means method iterating from 1 to 10

The best K value is 4 so we would conclude on  4 clusters in our output


# Summary

We did identify the classification 0f 531 cryptocurrencies based on similarities of their features The output is unknown, the best method would be unsupervised learning and clustering algorithms to group the currencies This classification report could be used by an investment bank to propose a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio to its clients.
